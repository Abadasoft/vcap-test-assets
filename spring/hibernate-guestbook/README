This directory contains a simple Java app that adds entries to a DB using
Hibernate directly i.e without using JPA.

To build this webapp:
1. Ensure that you have the JAVA_HOME environment variable defined to point to
   your JDK installation.
2. Ensure that you have Maven ('mvn') installed and included on your PATH
   environment variable.
3. Invoke "mvn clean package" from this directory. If all goes well, your
   webapp should be in "target/guestbook.war"

Alternately, you can import the "pom.xml" into your IDE as an existing Maven
project import and invoke the Maven "package" goal.
