This application is used to verify that the URLs it exposes are available
immediately for user traffic after the app has been started as per the
expectation of Cloud Foundry applications.

This aspect of application startup is an issue because Tomcat exposes
lifecycle hooks and configuration options that allow one to tap into
more fine grained states of applications startup that leaves us open to
the possibility of declaring that an app is available for user traffic
too soon. This app helps verify that an app is truly available for user
traffic (i.e it indirectly verifies that the Tomcat configuration / lifecyle
registration & response are correct) when Cloud Foundry declares that is.

Some additional details:
a. With Tomcat 6, Cloud Foundry was relying on registering for and receipt of the
"j2ee.state.running" Lifecycle event [see lifecycle events published by Tomcat
in "org.apache.catalina.Lifecycle"] to declare that an application was
available or that its state is "RUNNING" as reported by Cloud Foundry API.
b. With Tomcat 7, we rely on setting the "bindOnInit" configuration to "false"
and having Tomcat bind the HTTP connector to the socket after it (and indirectly
the web deployed in the Tomcat container) has started. See
http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-7.0-doc/config/http.html
